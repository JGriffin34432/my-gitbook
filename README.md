# How to use the \`.meme\` command.

1\) Creating a meme with G4M3R is really easy. In the beginning you have to select a meme background template.

2\) You can select that my searching for a certain term like `.meme add girl` or you can just type `.meme add` and you will get all available templates to select from.

3\) We will now search for that girl meme and continue with that by selecting it with its respective number.

4\) After selecting the meme template you have to provide an **UPPER TEXT** or a underscore to leave the **TOP** area empty.

5\) Same game with the bottom text. Provide some text or an underscore to leave it empty.

6\) Now G4M3R asks you to provide a custom name for your meme, so you will later recognize it in your meme repository.

7\) Finally you have options to just post the meme, post and save or to only save the meme without posting.

8\) Next time you want to use that meme again you have two options.

9\) Either write `.meme <the name of what you called your meme>` in our case this would be `.meme the girl that hacked the fire`

10\) Or you just write `.meme` and get access to all your saved memes and then you can continue from there.

11\) I hope now it is more clear on how to use G4M3R's meme generator.
